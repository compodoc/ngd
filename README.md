## Install

Install from npm: `npm install -g angular2-dependencies-graph`

## Usage

```
$ ngd --help

Usage: ngd [options]

Options:

  -h, --help               output usage information
  -V, --version            output the version number
  -f, --file [file]        Entry *.ts file
  -p, --tsconfig [config]  A tsconfig.json
  -l, --files [list]       A list of *.ts files
  -o, --open               Open the generated diagram file
  -s, --silent             In silent mode, log messages aren't logged in the console
  -d, --output [folder]    Where to store the generated files
```

### 1) use a `tsconfig.json`:
Run inside your project (where your `tsconfig.json` is located):

```bash
$ cd my-awesome-cli-angular2-app/
$ ngd
$ # or
$ ngd -p ./tsconfig.json
```

Note: This will read the `files` entry point in your `tsconfig.json` and crawl your app. If the entry point is not
found, all `*.ts` files will be crawled, but not those mentioned in the `exclude` property ([more details](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig.json.html#details)).

### 2) provide an entry file:

```bash
$ cd my-awesome-cli-angular2-app/
$ ngd -f src/main.ts
```

NOTE: The file you provide should contain your root component.
